Basic Tomato Sauce 
3 lg Cloves Garlic; chopped
1 lg Onion; chopped
125 g Streaky bacon/coppa (optional)
2 tb Butter, lard or bacon fat OR 3 tb Olive oil
1 lg Carrot; diced
1 kg Tomatoes; skinned & chopped
150 ml Dry white or red wine
Salt, pepper, sugar
Dried oregano
Chopped fresh basil


Soften the garlic, onion and bacon, if used, in the fat. Add the carrot, tomatoes and wine, breaking down canned tomatoes with a wooden spoon. Raise the heat and cook hard, uncovered for 15 minutes, or more slowly for 45 minutes if the tomatoes are canned. Add seasonings and oregano after 10 minutes. The chopped basil should put in just before serving and a little more scattered over the top. As a general principle, aim to finish with a chunky puree that is moist rather than watery. If you are freezing the sauce, you will find this the most useful texture. If you want to smooth out the sauce a little, without spoiling its vigorous character, put it through the coarse plate of a moulinette. If you are using some of the puree to to flavour other sauces, e.g. sauce aurore, put it through the medium plate. If you want to make cream of tomato soup, a blender is the thing.
